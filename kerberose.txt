ubuntu@ip-172-31-14-109:~$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /data
mkdir: Permission denied: user=ubuntu, access=WRITE, inode="/":hdfs:supergroup:drwxr-xr-x
ubuntu@ip-172-31-14-109:~$  export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs

with trick
ubuntu@ip-172-31-14-109:~$ export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs
ubuntu@ip-172-31-14-109:~$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /data
ubuntu@ip-172-31-14-109:~$ hdfs dfs -ls /

7 node cluster:
1 cm 
3 master 
3 worker 
deploy kerberos cluster 
set up:
